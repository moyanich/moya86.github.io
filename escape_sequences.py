# Escape Sequences
# E.G:
# Using your knowledge of escape sequences,
# create a single print() statement with single string inside of it that
# displays an upside down tree when the program is run:
# see @ https://linuxconfig.org/list-of-python-escape-sequence-characters-with-examples
#

# New line ''\n
print("First Line\nSecond Line")
print("\n")
print("********\n *****\n  ***\n   *")


# Output
# First Line
# Second Line
#
# ********
#  *****
#   ***
#    *
